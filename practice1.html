        <h3><strong>Road Sign Detection by Fuzzy Segmentation Approach and recognition by Artificial Neural Network Classifier</strong></h3><br>
        <ul><li><strong>Description:</strong>Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system is a significant component of the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) as traffic signs assist the drivers to drive more safely and efficiently.
                This project represents a new approach for the TSR system where detection of a traffic sign is carried out using fuzzy rules based color segmentation method and recognition is accomplished using Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) descriptor,
                trained by an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier.</li></ul><br>
        <h3><strong>Privacy-Preserving Public Auditing for Secure Cloud Storage</strong></h3><br>
        <ul><li><strong>Description:</strong>Using cloud storage, users can remotely store their data and enjoy the on-demand high-quality applications and services from a shared pool of configurable computing resources, without the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in cloud computing a formidable task,
                 especially for users with constrained computing resources.</li></ul><br>
        <h3><strong>Global Positioning System (GPS)</strong></h3><br>
        <ul><li>Description:Mobile ROUTE tracker application finds location & navigates you to the nearest Place with shortest path. Get directions to the nearest Place or ROUTE is done by using GPS Receiver.
            A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth.
             Each satellite continuously transmits messages that include Latitude and Longitude. The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite</li></ul><br>
