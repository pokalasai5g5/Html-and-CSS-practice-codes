<div class="city"><p>A hub airport is one served by a
    multitude of airlines, connecting
    several airports through non-stop
    fights.
    Historically, airports were designed keeping the requirements
    of the origin/destination passenger in mind. This meant operating
    separate arrival and departure
    terminals.</p></div>
